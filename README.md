#CookieJar

CookieJar is a simple tool that lets you grab cookies from browsers from different users, store them in a local sqlite database, and inject them
 again into any of the supported browsers. In the future, we will implement a feature to add cookies yourself, edit them, and inject these custom
 cookies as well.

This is currently written to work with **Python 3** on **Windows** and **Linux** platforms. As I don't own a Mac, and never will, Mac will not be
 supported. If you own a Mac, and you feel like contributing to this project, feel free to fork, and help us!

Support for Python 2.7 is planned for the future

##Supported browsers
We currently support Mozilla Firefox and Chromium on Linux platforms and Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome on Windows.

##Disclaimer
As with all tools, it can be used for good and evil. We are not responsible for your actions, so use the tool at own risk. Make sure you follow the
 privacy and computer laws of your country.
