          <h1>CookieJar</h1>
          <p>
            CookieJar is a simple tool that lets you grab cookies from browsers from different users, store them in a local sqlite database, and
            inject them again into any of the supported browsers. In the future, we will implement a feature to add cookies yourself, edit them,
            and inject these custom cookies as well.
          </p>
          <h2>Supported browsers</h2>
          <p>
            We currently support Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Chromium on Linux platforms and Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome on Windows.
          </p>
